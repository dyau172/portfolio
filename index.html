            <p>I have recently finished my degree and now have no idea what to do with myself. I am anxiously waiting
              for the results, but during my free time I like to play boardgames and ride my bike. It's fun. I also like
              like to eat. Mostly snacks but I sneak in something healthy when I'm not looking. </p>

          <div class="col">
            <p>I should also put something here. I have a 2 year old, so I also do a lot of finger painting and block
              building. I sneak in some CodeAcademy learning in the dead of the night. It used to be coursework related
              stuff but since I've finished that I have some free time. </p>
